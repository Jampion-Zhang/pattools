	abstract = {Next-generation methylation-aware sequencing of DNA sheds light on the fundamental role of methylation in cellular function in health and disease. These data are commonly represented at a single CpG resolution, while single-molecule fragment-level analysis is often overlooked.Here, we present wgbstools, an extensive computational suite tailored for methylation sequencing data. wgbstools allows fast access and ultra-compact anonymized representation of high-throughput methylome data, obtained through various library preparation and sequencing methods. Additionally, wgbstools contains state-of-the-art algorithms for genomic segmentation, biomarker identification, genetic and epigenetic data integration, and more. wgbstools offers fragment-level analysis and informative visualizations, across multiple genomic regions and samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.WGBSwhole-genome bisulfite sequencingRRBSreduced representation bisulfite-sequencingEM-seqenzymatic methylation sequencingDMRdifferentially methylated regionsDMBdifferentially methylated blocksPCRpolymerase chain Reaction},
